![NadBin](nadbin.png)

Temporary anonymous file sharing

**NadBin is still in development and not ready for production use.**  
And the code is very shitty, I'm working on it, I promise :D

## Why NadBin?

-   Extremely easy to setup
-   Direct downloads without redirects
-   Very lightweight (at least on the client side)
